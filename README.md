# Veterinary-Clinic-Cost-Calculator

## Description
This application is a management interface for a veterinary clinic, developed using Java Swing. It allows users to intuitively and efficiently calculate the costs of veterinary visits.

**Functionality**
Users can interact with the application by selecting the type of visit (such as Annual, Vaccine, Urgency, or Hospitalization) and the client status (Regular or VIP). They can also enter an additional charge, which is added to the total cost of the service.

Once all the data is entered, the application validates the input to ensure the values are correct. If an error is found, such as a negative value for the additional charge, the application provides a clear message to guide the user in correcting the input.

The base costs are automatically calculated based on the type of visit and the client status, applying discounts where applicable. Additionally, factors like the type of pet and its weight are considered, adjusting the final cost of the consultation. For instance, dogs weighing over 50 kg incur a surcharge, while those weighing less than 5 kg may receive a discount.

After all calculations are completed, the application displays the base cost, IVA, and the total amount due on a clear and organized screen. This facilitates quick and easy understanding of the charges for users.

The interface is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, allowing users to navigate easily and perform calculations without complications.
